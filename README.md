# MathWorks MATLAB project template

This is my folder skeleton for MathWorks MATLAB projects.

## In order to use it
	- git clone https://github.com/speredenn/matlab-project-template.git
	- cd matlab-projet-template
	- bash generate.sh your-project-name
	- cd ../your-project-name # then... Happy hacking!

## when code is ready
	- bash publish.sh
	
## TODO
 - change publish.sh in a makefile able to publish and to fetch the dependencies (make and make deps);
 - include in that make file the init.sh and the generate.sh scripts.
 - update dependency technique with git include? would be great!
